# 自游助手-AI-Transnational-Free-Travel-Assistant-APP

随着经济发展和生活水平的提高，人们对精神文化的需求进一步上升，旅游成为人们的基本生活方式，是人们使用休闲时间的最佳选择之一。最近几年发展蓬勃的跨国自由行已经渐入大众的接受范围。随之带来的问题就是由于语言方面的关系在观光，住宿消费等领域存在不便。“自游助手”APP正是基于此情况而设计出的，专为中日两国游客异国自由行的辅助应用。利用现代AI技术辅助游客，对当地景点介绍、餐馆、住宿、交通等信息进行提供与推荐。

With the economic development and the improvement of living standards, people's demand for spiritual culture has further increased. Tourism has become people's basic way of life and one of the best choices for people to use leisure time. In recent years, the booming transnational free travel has gradually entered the scope of public acceptance. The accompanying problem is that there are inconveniences in tourism, accommodation consumption and other fields due to the relationship of language. The "Self-Travel Assistant" APP is designed based on this situation and is an auxiliary application for tourists from China and Japan to travel independently. Using modern AI technology to assist tourists, provide and recommend information on local attractions, restaurants, accommodation, transportation, etc.
